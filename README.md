# Documentation

pong is a simple 3D game which aims to be as a reference implementation of how a game should be developed with rock.js & rock.game.js.

If you want to play pong you can do [here](https://lajimenez.github.com/pong/demo)

## Development

The project has been 'mavenized' so if you are familiar with maven you shouldn't have problems with the project folder structure. If not, you can found maven tutorials anyplace :P
At this moment, you will have to revise the code yourself as there is no technical documentation.

## How to generate minified version

Open the terminal and navigate to the correct folder. Then execute:
```Batchfile
mvn clean compile
```
