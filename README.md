# Hi developer!

I started this project some years ago. I did just for fun and I learned a lot. Although it's not maintained anymore, still today there are some people who clone this project.
If you are one of them and want to say to me whatever you want, please don't hesitate to send me an email to [lajimenez.rock@gmail.com](mailto:lajimenez.rock@gmail.com)

# Documentation

pong is a simple 3D game which aims to be as a reference implementation of how a game should be developed with rock.js & rock.game.js.

If you want to play pong you can do [here](https://lajimenez.github.io/pong/demo)

## Development

The project has been 'mavenized' so if you are familiar with maven you shouldn't have problems with the project folder structure. If not, you can found maven tutorials anyplace :P
At this moment, you will have to revise the code yourself as there is no technical documentation.

## How to generate minified version

Open the terminal and navigate to the correct folder. Then execute:
```Batchfile
mvn clean compile
```
